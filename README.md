# Bash Shortcuts
An evolving collection of my favourite bash scripts and shortcuts to increase productivity and consistency

*Note: I use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for windows 10. Some code might not be fully correct for your environment, and some programs may need to be installed to use the scripts (e.g [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))*
